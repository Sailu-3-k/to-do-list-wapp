# Todo-web app


Day by day, the tech-stacks are evolving. Currently, one of the best frameworks for backend development is Adonis.js which uses MVC design patterns.

Here you will be learning the basics of this framework while building the backend of ToDo web application. Also, you will be learning how backends can be developed independent of the frontend for any full-stack application with help of REST API. 

Building a UI (User Interface) for this particular application is beyond the scope of this project and Though we will keep features at a basic level, you are welcome to add more features & make your ToDo backend more dynamic.
